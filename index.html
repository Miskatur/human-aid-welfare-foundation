            They need your <span class="help">Help!</span></h1>

        <p>
            Last month, a devastating flash flood struck the northeastern districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj in
            Bangladesh. <br>
            The continuous heavy rainfall in the north-eastern Indian region terribly affected more than 2 million
            people
            who live <br> on the Surma-Kushiyara river's bank of Bangladesh. Kanaighat, Gowainghat, Companyganj,
            Jaintapur,
            Zakiganj, Sylhet sadar, <br> Fenchuganj, and many more upazillas of Sylhet as well as several upazilas of
            Sunamganj
            and Netrokona districts have been inundated. They need our
            help to overcome this situation. So be a part of us.
