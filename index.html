                They need your <span class="help">Help!</span></h1>

            <p>
                Last month, a devastating flash flood struck the northeastern districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj in
                Bangladesh. <br>
                The continuous heavy rainfall in the north-eastern Indian region terribly affected more than 2 million
                people
                who live <br> on the Surma-Kushiyara river's bank of Bangladesh. Kanaighat, Gowainghat, Companyganj,
                Jaintapur,
                Zakiganj, Sylhet sadar, <br> Fenchuganj, and many more upazillas of Sylhet as well as several upazilas
                of
                Sunamganj
                and Netrokona districts have been inundated. They need our
                help to overcome this situation. So be a part of us.

            <p> <b>“When a person dies, all their deeds end except three: a continuing charity, beneficial knowledge and
                    a
                    child who prays for them,” (Hadith, Muslim).</b> <br>
                Therefore, Muslims are eager to give charity which will continue to have benefit to people after their
